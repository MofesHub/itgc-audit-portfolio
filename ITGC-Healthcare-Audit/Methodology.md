# Audit Methodology

This simulated engagement followed a risk-based internal audit methodology.

## Design vs Operating Effectiveness
- Design: whether the control, if executed, would prevent or detect the risk.
- Operating: whether the control was executed consistently during the period.

## Pattern Identification
Repeated exceptions or clustered failures indicate systemic issues and result in ineffective ratings.

## Risk Calibration
Risk ratings considered system criticality, frequency of exceptions, and potential impact in a healthcare context.
